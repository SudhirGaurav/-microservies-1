	1.Video : 149.
	2.as u can see  in CurrencyConversionController.java[18], for one microservice call ,we need to write 20 lines of code .IN real work  appl, there could be 1000 MS , think once how many line of code is needed for for .
		ThereFore , Spring cloud provided a FW called Feng ,which will handle to call multiple microservices.
	3. This is Spring cloud framework. 
	4.It is used for calling MSs
	5. This can NOT  used for handle load-balancing easily [bellow is reason] 
	6. code bellow is problme .
		@FeignClient(name = "currency-exchange" , url = "localhost:8000")
		 Hardcoded port is biggest issue. this is king of static MS calling.
		 we can not run MSs dinimically bcz url port is hardcoded .
		 
		 So Hardcode port is the problem therefore need to go for Naming server ....
